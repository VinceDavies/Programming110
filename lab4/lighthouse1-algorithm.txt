1. Objective: calculate the distance in miles a ship at sea can see the lighthouse.

2. Requirements:
--INPUT
height (set by author or user)


--PROCESSING
distance = square root of 0.8 * height

--OUTPUT
objective
author
user instructions (if any)
label1 "A "
label2 " foot tall lighthouse can be seen from "
label3 " miles away." 
height (unformatted)
distance (formatted to 0 digits past the decimal point and no decimal point)


--DATA
height-->>height of lighthouse in feet (integer)
distance-->>distance from the lighthouse in miles (decimal)


3. Algorithm Instructions
10 output objective
20 output author
30 output user instructions (if any)
40 height = set by author or user
50 distance = square root of 0.8 * height
60 output label1
70 output height
80 output label2
90 output distance formatted to 0 digits past the decimal point and no decimal point
100 output label3
110 END



4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: height=100.  expected output is "A 100 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from 9 miles away." (NOT 8.94427191)
10 output objective
20 output author
30 output user instructions (if any)
40 height = 100
50 distance = square root of 0.8 * 100
60 A 
70 100
80 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from
90 9
100 miles away.
110 END
