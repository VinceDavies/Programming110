1. Objective: calculate monthly mortgage payment over a 30 year payback period.

2. Requirements:
--INPUT:
p (assigned by author or user)
interestRate (specified by author or user)
paybackPeriod = 30 (years)
password = studentid#

--PROCESSING:
r = interestRate / 12
n = paybackPeriod * 12
payment = (p * (1 + r)^n * r) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)


--OUTPUT:
objective
author
user instructions (if any)
label1 "Amount borrowed (programmer input) = $"
label2 "Annual interest rate (programmer input) = "
label3 "%"
label4 "Payback period (programmer input) = "
label5 " Years"
label6 "Monthly payment (calculated output) = $"
label7 "Please enter your password.It is your student ID number."
label8 "Bro that's incorrect, please try again pal."
p
interestRate
paybackPeriod
payment


--DATA:
interestRate-->>annual interest rate (decimal unformatted)
paybackPeriod-->>time period to payback the amount borrowed (integer)
p-->>amount borrowed (integer)
r-->>monthly percent interest rate (decimal)
n-->>number of monthly payments in a payback period (integer)
payment-->>calculated monthly payment (decimal formatted to 2 digits past the decimal point)
studentID-->>1163070

3. Algorithm instructions
10 output objective
20 output author
25 output label7
26 get user input and compare it to studentID. if correct, allow user to continue. else: output label8
30 Prompt the user to enter the dollar amount borrowed as a whole number (for example, for $500,000, enter 500000).
40 Prompt the user to enter the annual percent interest rate, with any number of decimal digits (for example, for 5.85% annual interest rate, enter 5.85. For 6%, enter 6).

1c. Calculate the monthly payment in dollars, as a floating-point number.
1d. Include in the output an echo of the input amount borrowed, the annual percent interest rate
(without formatting) and the payback period (in years).
1e. Include in the output the calculated monthly payment, formatted to show two decimal places 
(like this: 1000.00)
50 paybackPeriod = 30
60 n = paybackPeriod *12
70 r = interestRate / 12
80 payment = (p * (1 + r)^n * r) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
90 output label1 
100 output p and end line
110 output label2
120 output interestRate
130 output label3 and end line
140 output label4
150 output paybackPeriod
160 output label5 and end line
170 output label6
180 output payment and end line
190 END


4. Test Cases
Test Case #1: INPUT: (try1) password=banana (try2) password=1163070 p=$270 000  interestRate=5.125%  paybackPeriod=30  expected OUTPUT payment=$1470.00
10 output objective
20 output author
25 output labe7
26 banana != 1163070 -->> output label8
27 1163070==1163070 -->> continue with program
30 p = 270000
40 interestRate = .05125
50 paybackPeriod = 30
60 n = 30 *12
70 r = .05125 / 12
80 payment = (270000 * (1 + .05125 / 12)^30 *12 * .05125 / 12) / ((1 + .05125 / 12)^30 *12 - 1)
90 Amount borrowed = $ 
100 270000
110 Annual interest rate  =
120 .05125
130 % 
140 Payback period  = 
150 30
160  Years
170 Monthly payment  = $
180 1470.00
190 END
