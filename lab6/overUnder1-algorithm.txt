1. Objective
randomly generate an integer between 1 and 10, input user guess as to what number it is, and output "correct!" if the user guess is the random number, or "high" if the user guess is too high, or "low" if the user guess is too low.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
int guess

PROCESSING:
number=math.random(0,10)
if guess==number--> break loop
if guess<number --> print "low"
if guess>number --> print "high"

OUTPUT:
instructions
string label1= "low"
string label2= "high"
string label3= "correct!"
string label4= "Please guess a number between 1 and 10."

DATA:
int guess
int number


3. Instructions
10 output user instructions
20 number=math.random(0,10)
25 prompt user for input integer between 1 and 10.
30 if guess==number--> break loop
40 if guess<number --> print "low"
50 if guess>number --> print "high"
60 END

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:The random number is comes up as 5. Input values if any:guess=6, then guess=5
10 output user instructions
20 number=5
30 guess=6
35 output high
40 guess=5
50 output "correct!"
60 END
