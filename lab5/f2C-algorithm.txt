user instructions: "Enter a temperature in farenheit to have its equivalent temperature in Celcius displayed."
output prompt to user to ask for temperature in degrees F
output temperature in degrees C.

--DATA:
f=determined by user
c = 5 * (f - 32) / 9

4. Test cases
Test Case #1: farenheit=32
c=5*(32-32)/9
c=0
output "32 degrees farenheit is 0 degrees celcius"
